Last night I started thinking about appauvrissement again. I remembered something my mom used to always say when I was applying to colleges. She was a big fan of Columbia and their core curriculum. She would say that you never know when you will be at a job interview and the Odyssey or some other classic piece of literature could come up. Columbia would prepare myself for this, give me a lexicon of cultural pieces to always call on to impress whatever recruiter or employer.

I always thought of a liberal arts education holding its value from making people into well-informed, culturally aware and participating citizens. I never thought about it as just a tool to make myself into a more employable person in corporate America.

When I remind myself of that TikTok and how people don't consume art or embrace experiences where they are not the center, I wonder if the truth is more bleak. Maybe even the consumption of art to many is simply a way to become more appealable to companies and firms who want better people at work.

I've been thinking of a photoshoot I want to do this/next year and this is a main thing of contention.
