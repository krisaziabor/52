These days I find it particularly difficult to understand what it means to be a designer, why I want to design, and who I want to design for. I’ve started asking myself why I chose graphic design in the first place. Was I too afraid to commit to painting? Did I even like painting? Or am I fantasizing (yet again) about an alternate, escapist world? This train of questioning is one of many that has started keeping me up at night. In the following artist statement, I dissect two questions about my practice that I have been too afraid to ask during the light of day. Please excuse my honesty.

1. Who actually cares? (about paper thickness, binding style, Helvetica vs Futura, and the like.)

I have a confession: sometimes in the thick of designing, I do a shameful thing that no good designer does: when I feel like I am running out of time, I give up on my intent and make my next decision based on efficiency. I was told it is called decision paralysis: the inability to make a decision for fear of making the wrong choice or being overwhelmed by too many options. Under frustration, my shame compounds: for once caring so much and then suddenly caring so little. In this moment of paralysis, it is difficult to remember that frustration is part of the process, an essential pillar to the problem-solving satisfaction that drew me into the design process in the first place. Google suggests that to combat this increasingly familiar feeling, I should practice making decisions quickly and/or bouncing ideas with a peer. I agree with these statements and they implore me to be more patient: not only in my design-decision-making processes but also with myself, everyday.

2. Is my design even good?

In a conversation with my woodworking professor Sae-Jun Kim in the fall of 2023, I shared with him: my sculpture ideas and physical work suck. He entertains my thoughts, “Isn’t it a bit narcissistic to think that everything you make will be good?”. I realize in retrospect that as much as I cared about his approval of my work, he didn’t care if it was good at all. He only cared that I was in the woodshop, learning more about myself and my making process everyday. I found graphic design a semester after graduating from his class. Though his words often escape me in practice, I am finally writing them down today in hopes of cementing them into my practice. In my rendition of his words, I tell myself: who cares if, right now, my is not visually pleasing or well liked? I am a student. Even if it is, it will not always be good. My design is good if I am learning more about my process and more about myself. As long as I know I want to keep making, and I continue to create, I am on the right track.

In analyzing these two questions, many more have come up: Outside of client work, what do I want to design about? Do I have what it takes to do this forever? Will I ever make work that will be ‘seen’? The questions get more extreme as I fight them in a half-asleep-half-awake phase. Still, it is clear that a common theme runs through: I need to be more patient with myself, building an understanding that will (hopefully) be felt with my audience once it is there. When I give myself the time to feel my designs both physically and emotionally, I will find the satisfaction and drive that keeps self-doubt at bay. In any case, my goal right now shouldn’t be to design well or to design quickly. It should be to design with intention and care.

As an artist, it is my job to keep learning: about my artistic processes, the ones of those around me, the people I design for/with. It's hard to keep such a broad goal. To break this learning down into manageable steps, I’ve decided to keep a meticulous list of quotes from readings, talks, and acquaintances that struck a particular cord with me. Here are some collected over the last week:

- In the Q&A portion of Beka Sturges’ talk _Fair Play_ at the Yale School of Architecture, she talks about how we live in a post-native world and the importance of considering this, in tandem with spatial and cultural environments, when building ways for people to interact with their natural environment.
- Graphic designer Barbara Glauber gives a short presentation _Combining Texts_ where she says that “I get away with a lot because I always have a reason behind my decisions.” She also talks about the importance of conversation and collaborating with people from all walks of life in a tangent about her art-curator-best-friend.
- Barbara also shows us her work for the Tang Teaching Museum & Art Gallery which uses distinct pairs of typefaces like Sunset Pro and Operator Mono. These are unconventional, ornamental type yet she weaves them together so beautifully in her books.
- In an excerpt from the book _Process_ by BankerWessel, four designers in Stockholm come together for a conversation on process. Some of my favorite quotes from this reading are how design is “bringing together all of the factors and finding the solution, ‘x’ that brings it all together,” sketching early is like “sowing the seed,” of a good design, and multiple reminders about how research should come early in the process.
- Prompted by a question about choosing font pairings, Kristian Henson tells me that choosing two is like magic and alchemy. Sometimes words sparkle on the page in a good or bad way and printing often is an important way to observe this.
- In the article called _Typographic Design Authorship_, I am introduced to the “Relational Aesthetics theory” which describes how design is a “a set of artistic practices which take as their theoretical and practical point of departure the whole of human relations and their social context, rather than an independent and private space”. French curator Nicholas Bourriaud saw artists as facilitators rather than makers.
- The same article discussed design as “entrepreneurial in her approach, the economic act becomes powering, and a form of authorship”

To be an artist is to create when no one is looking. It is to be unafraid to be seen (or unseen) and undoubting when making strokes and strides. It is to be prolific in  quantity, persistent during troughs, and relentless when it flows. It means feeling hard and having difficulty. It is creating boundaries that protect a practice that is sacred and personal. It is setting an example through pictures and words. It is understanding that things will be difficult but what will be made will be worth it if there is learning involved. The purpose of art is to transform through expression or a lack of it. It is to follow rules or break them with intention.

In making art I want to be more brave, more ugly, and more extreme as I learn to create. It is to feel alone and make time for these feelings to appear. In these hours I am able to marinate, digest, and flow through my ideas. I can confront my feelings in the wake of these hours, knowing myself more fully so I can be better for those around me.

Workshopping the answer to the question, **what are you looking to achieve?**

Sheila de Bretteville often writes about the importance of personal value in shaping a designer’s voice. Line, shape, typography, and margins compose our visual storytelling language. Her ideas encourage me to be brave, using methodological systems to create clever designs. Whether it's using video clips to model the strokes of my newest typeface or diving into Yale archives to bring a historical voice back to life, I always push growth and learning in my work. I hope to bring these ambitions back to the Philippines, transforming a competitive environment of arts culture into one that is inclusive, making formal community spaces where artists can co-exist, share, and thrive together.

The Solow Model is a macroeconomic system that theorizes how countries grow until they inevitably reach a 'steady state' in the medium or long-run, at which point capital and technology have been efficiently used and output not savings will increase further. Only permanent shocks to total factor productivity or technology (A) and higher savings rate can really contribute anything to move steady state higher than it already is. Permanent increases to labor force, foreign aid, and capital depreciation can only slightly temporarily increase or decrease output until it eventually moves back to steady state. The further a country is from this steady state, the faster it grows until the transition dynamics slow and growth is constant.

I've never really tried to equate my two majors, Art and Economics, until last Friday I was standing in a critique during my Graphic Design Methodologies class and found myself thinking of the Solow model in terms of my making process. In the early stages, I try to maintain this quick growth stage by keeping my mind as open as possible to any and all possibilities, steering away from online references that could alter my initial influences. Then, as time goes on, growth perhaps doesn't slow but progress is less expansive. As I move closer to steady state, my motivation shrinks but I have to keep persisting in order to reach this point of maximal growth and satisfaction, at which point, I can put the point to rest. Until it deteriorates or another idea shocks me and then I'm away from steady state and back to the exacto board and InDesign. Its interesting to think about the many nuances of the model: where long term growth starts from, how to increase the steady state permanently or temporarily, adding the growth of ideas to extend the model. Quantifying my creative process is not my goal but an important tool in motivation, urging me to move forward even when it feels like everything is slowing down. That just means I'm closer than ever.

Books I read over Spring Break and my favorite takeaways from them, which I hope to bring forth into my work as an artist:

_Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea_, Jules Verne, 1870 > the power of imagination beyond impossibility and how important it is to imagine from new perspectices, to go beyond the realm of possibility, to be inspired and challenged by the unknowns, and to try to discover what we know now we don't know, and what we don't know we don't know

_Forbidden Notebook_, Alba de Céspedes, 1952 > the power of the matriarchy and journaling in order to help break down difficult thoughts and words, documenting how much we can grow in such short periods despite age and time period. the woman's frustrations resonate with me despite how far in time, age, and culture we both are. also the beauty of Rome, where I hope to visit soon.

_Dallergut Dream Department Store_, Miye Lee, 2020 > the power of the collective subconscious, particularly through dreams and their ability to help us overcome, experience, and emotionally challenge ourselves. dreams are remarkable and exciting, understudied, but experiences by every human and animal at some point. I was also struck by the career pivot of the author, moving from electrical engineering at Samsung to being a children's book writer.

_The Consolation of Maps_, Thomas Leveritt, 2005 > the profound impact and breadth of Yale's collections which I hope to take even more advantage every week, helping me complete my goal of 1 collection/week. a portion of the book was centered on the protagonist's visit to the Beinecke which felt extremely remarkable given the randomness of me stumbling upon the book and the true extensive nature of our map collection.

_The Course of Love_, Alain de Botton, 2016 > The pains of romantic love, which I hope I still have time away from. I want to put my energy into my friendships

_Violeta_, Isabel Allende, 2022 > another beautiful journal-documentary piece, similar yet so different from Alba's voice, documenting a families' journey that had me hooked from start to finish. I love this author yet this is the first book I've read by her, finished so quickly in a day, and I can't wait to read more from her soon. Particularly struck by the beauty of familial relationships which also remain at the center of my life, and also of the beauty of Chile where I hope to visit one day soon.

We imagine new ways by imagining perspectives that haven’t yet been imagined. We imagine that we know what we don’t know and we imagine what we don’t know we don’t know.
  
My mom taught me how to see, then my sisters, then my step mom then my dad. Then in college I started to teach myself how to see more. I left home at 18 with 2 suitcases in a state I had never seen before with not 1 person I knew.

Art surviving allows us to track culture and see how counter-culture and thinking changes with the ebs and flows of new trends. For example the move towards multisensory exhibitions and highly textiles work to counter the screen filled environments we face.
  
To the future, I am not sure. Maybe I hope that there is something to be said about community. Or that I don’t have to say anything to the future but I can show it and bring people together for a little bit of intentional time.

A list of notes and thoughts that have come up since I have recently started to limit my screen time. I am also trying to start writing a substack in lieu of being addicted to instagram reels which has painfully helped me through the long winter. I hope these might serve as better future prompts, reflecting on why I do what I do as an artist, why I love it, and the rules I break carefully when I create. Albeit nonsensical at times.

1. Don’t do what everyone is doing (or do so with intent)

2. I had always known that timing was everything but didn't know my patience would be tested so painfully when keeping this in mind. But its true,  timing is everything (when to find a subletter, when to move out or start buying furniture, when to reach out to friends), but the only thing that keeps me confident as a person (and thus an artist) is that staying true to my values extends my patience and thus my ability to arrive on time (whenever that might be)

3. My methodologies class recently visited a graduate student's architecture studio where we talked about all the different, unconventional ways that model making comes to fruition in their process. And how important this physical experimentation is. We talked about Painting as model (ala Pezo von Ellrichshausen) making, Video game as model making, Books as model making, rubiks cube as model making, and the model making as proof of concept.

4. When entering an artist exhibition or seeing a piece for the first time, ask yourself what your first intentions are. At the end of the exhibit, ask yourself what you got out from it. How do you use these perceptions to bridge the gap between what you want to convey and what you want to leave your audience with? We go through these steps in class critiques but it was interesting to see it through the perspective of a physical exhibition space.

5. Everything is perfect ≠ everything is real, and architecture is importantly real. Thought its fun to bring back the imagination aspect of it.

6. Yale MFA open studios is my Coachella.

**Good design gives more than it takes**
