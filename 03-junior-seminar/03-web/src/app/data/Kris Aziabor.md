The camera – my main mode of art making – is my machine of reflection and placing mental & physical places in the past. This is not the same as marking them as complete or finished; I always find myself returning to these homes of thought and experience eventually.

Institutional memory and its destruction – whether through explicit or surreptitious means – has always fascinated me and photography allows me to explore what types of experiences and creations belonging to me will be known to others after I leave places. Will my almost twenty years in my hometown of Atkinson, New Hampshire – where the black population is recorded as 0.0% be tattooed on the town’s body when I depart for the last time? Will my future photographs that encapsulate tensions and traditions encapsulating my view of Yale’s community belong in any archive across this campus? Will my thoughts and I – for my ugliness and beauty – be remembered?

By using a monochromatic aesthetic, I can create visuals that root viewers in a distinct, fleeting moment. I resist the idea that black and white photos will always evoke a feeling of timelessness. I enter every project with the intention of questioning this norm and placing the viewer in a particular moment or scene. Any ambition to create a timeless or finished work renders it lifeless. Its mortality and rebirth will always be the most beautiful.

A minimalistic photographer requires a minimalistic artist statement, right?

Kris Aziabor is a visual artist. Minimalistic aesthetics are combined with monochrome frames. Viewers are rooted in distinct, fleeting moments. Black and white photos go beyond timelessness. Any ambition to create a timeless or finished work renders it lifeless. Its mortality and rebirth will always be the most beautiful.

My works usually share a foundation of monochromatic inkjet prints that I try to add upon in different ways. Whether it is the addition of written text stamped on top of a print or layering acrylic and other types of ink onto the surface, I like to experiment with the viewer's access to my raw work. What does it mean when I block your viewership of my piece and force you to see and understand it through a limited lens?

In addition, I seek to create visuals that root viewers in a distinct, fleeting moment. I resist the idea that black and white photos will always evoke a feeling of timelessness.

For this week's artist statement, I want to explore one of the upcoming projects I have been thinking a lot about. Whether it is a website or an app or something else, who knows. But I know what I want to solve.

The internet has made us more individualized and less in tune with things that don't center us. In a IG reel I have watched maybe ten times this week, Cyberethnographer Ruby Thelot talks about the concept of appauvrissement, the idea that the culture is poorer due to the lack of cultivation of the audience. Now he spoke about this in regards to the broligachy who comes out of school, ready to sink their teeth into high-paying engineering jobs, and have no aesthetic ideals and understanding of art history.

I want to take this idea in another direction. Apps like TikTok and Instagram have tailored our whole experiences around content they believe we will like, and we become more deeply rooted as individuals because of it. We believe that we are the center of the universe because everything we consume is telling us so. And this is tragic for communities. When we also consider how third spaces are vanishing, it is no surprise that media literacy is at a damning low point and doesn't look like recovering anytime soon.

My project will be to visualize the nuances and intricate connections that every piece of media has to each other. Everything from Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl show to a 90s Ghanaian short film would have a home on the site, where the references, interpolations, and commentary that makes an art piece is all on a map. Viewers could see who was inspired by a certain work while also seeing what criticism came its way.

I am not sure how I will visualize this or how it will exist within an exhibition (i found out this week that that's a requirement for the Art thesis...). I do know what I am solving however. Our institutional memory needs restoring and more than just having a digital archive, it needs a visual one.

Last night I started thinking about appauvrissement again. I remembered something my mom used to always say when I was applying to colleges. She was a big fan of Columbia and their core curriculum. She would say that you never know when you will be at a job interview and the Odyssey or some other classic piece of literature could come up. Columbia would prepare myself for this, give me a lexicon of cultural pieces to always call on to impress whatever recruiter or employer.

I always thought of a liberal arts education holding its value from making people into well-informed, culturally aware and participating citizens. I never thought about it as just a tool to make myself into a more employable person in corporate America.

When I remind myself of that TikTok and how people don't consume art or embrace experiences where they are not the center, I wonder if the truth is more bleak. Maybe even the consumption of art to many is simply a way to become more appealable to companies and firms who want better people at work.

I've been thinking of a photoshoot I want to do this/next year and this is a main thing of contention.

I have been – quite unseriously – trying to secure an internship in product design this summer for the past few weeks. I am always making new small bios and statements that try to quickly express my skills and principles. Here are a few:

"Kris Atteh Kojo Aziabor is a chameleon, constantly shifting between making products, fine arts, & written works to uplift collective memories and knowledge above all else.

In his third year at Yale University, he leads the college's undergrad design studio – [Design at YaleLinks to an external site.](https://designatyale.com/) – and majors in Computing and the Arts.

Previously software (full-stack) at [Fidelity InvestmentsLinks to an external site.](https://www.fidelity.com/) and [cyclioLinks to an external site.](https://cyclio.webflow.io/)."

"Kris designs. He codes. He runs a studio too.

"Any ambition to create a timeless work renders it lifeless.  
Its cycle of mortality and rebirth will always be the most beautiful.

My last artist statement will be just a list of tasks I want to carry into all my future practices – whether I am making photos or designing web interfaces:

1. **Do not delete anything.** Even beyond that, reflect long and hard on the projects you abandon and the ideas you want to push to the back of your mind. There are truths within those choices that can open worlds.

2. **Every Sunday, build and organize your archive.** I have an app on my computer with 650+ visual inspirations that desperately needs organization and reflection. Cure the Sunday scaries by digging deep into the archive and trying to make some structure and meaning from it.

3. **Have fucking fun**. Photography, design, whatever it is – remember you choose to make these works and even the most tragic and serious pieces deserve some unseriousness. Do not let the prospect of great work or a great idea weigh you down and leave you with stress. Embrace showing people shitty work and enjoy the craft of making again.

You got this Kris, regardless of what 'this' is. -Kris
