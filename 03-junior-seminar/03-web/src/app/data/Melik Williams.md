My name is Melik Williams, I am a Junior at Yale University studying art with a focus in graphic design. I did not come to Yale as an artist, in fact, I came here as the exact opposite, a numbers and science guy. But since taking classes in both disciplines I've learned that there is so much more I want to do than type equations.

I'm not too sure what I want to do in art, whether it's making work to show off, typesetting books, or something else entirely, but I feel that my strong suit is that I am able to adapt quickly, pick up new skills relatively easily, and am always curious to learn more. As an athlete, I am also very open and willing to receive feedback, as I know that is how I get better at anything I want to be successful in.

As for art that I am passionate about I love animated and drawn media. Comic books are my second language and anytime I can get my hands on a new edition or volume is euphoric to me. I love to try to emulate the styles of artists that I admire but I am also curious to see how my work can deviate from it in my own way. I still don't feel like I have my own style but I feel that with constant work I will find one that fits me.

I often have this conflict in my mind, what is an artist? What does being an artist mean to me? I feel like the answers are both so much and so little. But I feel like the answer in my heart is simple. An artist is someone who creates, but also has passion for what is is that they are creating. I feel like an artist can be as broad as you could possibly want. A cook is an artist, as they create, and what's more passionate with a meal "made with love". I feel like the "quality" of the work is super irrelevant. As long as someone put their heart into what they made there's someone in the world who would appreciate it.  I feel like even an athlete could easily be considered an artist. They create and express themselves constantly in how they move and the thought that goes into how they move, how is that any different from a dancer, and a dancer is an athlete. These terms are not mutually exclusive, "artist" can be applied to almost any facet. To be an artist is to love what you are doing and constantly trying to hone the skills you have and trying to see how far you can push your ideas and execution. To be an artist is to be human because to have desire and ambition is to be human. But that's super philosophical so that might be too much.

I really do disdain my own sense of procrastination. I feel like it makes my artistic work flow so bad. I'm still somewhat in the mind of someone who does math and sciences and used to excel in it. Not doing work because I "don't feel like it" along with waiting until the last minute to jump into max crunch time and get something on the paper/document. I think it says something that I can get it done but I think it says even more about what I can do. I always fall back on the reasoning that I'm tired and I'll do better work when I'm in a different situation but I feel like all I could be doing is building bad habits for myself. The worst part is how much freedom art gives me to have ideas. Sometimes, I'm able to come up with ideas that would realistically both take a lot of careful work and application but at the same time could/would turn out well. And once I start working on the idea it's a lot of fun to apply my vision. The only problem is that I had waited until a day or two before the assignment was due. So I have to greatly downsize or cut corners of my ideas. Which leaves my execution falling flat, which disappoints me as I do get excited for ideas that I really wish to apply myself on. Building good habits is something that I do all the time outside of school in athletics and other extracurriculars. I just need to focus on applying them in school as well.
