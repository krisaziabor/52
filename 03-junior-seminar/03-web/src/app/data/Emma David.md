## 01

My name is Emma David, and I am a photographer from Long Island, New York, currently based in New Haven, Connecticut. I am a junior at Yale University, pursuing an undergraduate degree in art with a concentration in graphic design.

Since coming to Yale, I’ve taken only a few art classes, and I’m still exploring different creative avenues. Right now, my practice focuses on sports photography, capturing images for the athletic department at Yale. I’m also delving into graphic design and digital drawing, and recently, I’ve developed an interest in filmmaking. I’m still figuring out how I can combine all of these elements together and make them my own, but I’m enjoying the process of experimenting.

Emma David is a photographer and graphic designer from Long Island, New York, currently based in New Haven, Connecticut. She is a junior at Yale University, pursuing an undergraduate degree in art with a concentration in graphic design.

Recently she’s been combining digital drawing and graphic design as she focuses on her “Studio Lottery” assignment. Through this project, she creates designs in the style of matchboxes for various places on Yale’s campus as if they were illustrated on matchbox covers. She’s exploring the ideas between reality and illusion as she blends formal design and distortion, merging her “studio” with familiar surroundings in an unnatural way.

I just realized that I completely missed this week’s artist statement, so I’m going to write it now, reflecting on my perspective from a month ago. Around this time I started to try and approach my work in a way that feels more like mine. Oftentimes I treat school assignments like a to-do list, just trying to get them done, but I’m starting to shift that mindset while I work on a project involving a matchbox. At first the matchbox felt small and confined, but the more I sat with it I realized the possibilities of things I could create were endless, making me more aware of the artistic potential small, ordinary, everyday objects hold. Moving forward I hope to approach my art with the same sense of curiosity and hope to find new inspiration from unexpected places.

Recently, I’ve been exploring framing in drawing, a concept I hadn't thought about too much outside of photography and videography. I’m experimenting with angles and abstraction, moving outside the frame rather than staying within it and representing objects through thought rather than their original forms.

Last week, my digital video professor said to me, “Before videoing, make sure you have a reason for every frame, and if you don’t have a reason, don’t take it at all.” That idea has stayed with me—not just in video but in all of my creative work. So often I start off with creating and find my ideas coming as I go. It’s made me question a lot of my decisions and wonder how different the outcomes would have been if I had clearer intentions to begin with. But, it also makes me wonder if with that approach I would lose the small details that make my art mine.

My name is Emma David, and I’m a photographer from Long Island, New York. I’m currently studying graphic design at Yale University, where I’ve been exploring how design and photography can work together. I wouldn’t say I have work yet, but my creations are mostly inspired from where I come from–familiar places and the in-between. The in-between being whatever I make out of my surroundings because embarrassingly, I don’t like stepping too far outside of my comfort zone. Instead, I like pushing the boundaries of what can be done within. Making something out of the mundane is when I feel like I make my best “work” because I have all the creative power in those moments to amplify my own perspective or highlight what others might overlook. All in all, it’s less about what I’m capturing and more about how I choose to see it–or want others to see it.

Over Spring break I visited my cousins in San Diego for one of their bachelorette parties. In the car when she picked me up I was telling her about this assignment and how I had no clue what to do for it. She sarcastically said, “You should be a San Diegan and when we go to Palm Springs you should be super outgoing and a little social butterfly,” just to mess with me. Immediately I was like no, that’s dumb, you’re so annoying, and I'm not doing that…but then I proceeded to do exactly that. I’m super shy and have been thinking about ways I could use my imposter to get photos I’m happy with. Whenever it comes to photographing strangers (even when I have permission) I still feel wrong and like I have to be secretive about them. Stepping outside of my comfort zone like this is something I hope to continue doing and incorporating in my future artistic practices.

I'm not gonna lie, I'm struggling with these. I love these questions and have been thinking more deeply than I’d like to admit about them…especially about who taught me how to see. But, every discussion post I write out I cannot help but laugh at myself. Instead, (inspired by Emma’s artist statement earlier this semester), I’m going to answer each question with animal-emoji ambiguity due to my inability to be serious this week. But, for example, re-imaging relation would be a unicorn because changing the imaginable just becomes a construction of our own desires, which is where the artistic process thrives but also poses the question of what’s an acceptable boundary? What steps outside of the box just enough, but not too much? Anyways (in order of the questions): 🦝, 🦔, 🐈‍⬛, 🐙, 🐶, 🐘, 🪰, 🦄, 🦥, 🦦, 🙉
