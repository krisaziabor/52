# Jaiden Blais-Ellis

## 01

My name is Jaiden Blais-Ellis, and I am junior at Yale University studying Computing and the Arts. At Yale, I've taken a variety of classes to develop my artistic skills, such as painting, graphic design, animation, computer graphics, and web design. I am also co-artistic director of the Yale Children's Theater.

I am first and foremost a storyteller. I like to spin yarns in many different mediums, including prose, animation, tabletop role play, and theater, and I'm particular interested in the different strengths of these different mediums. For instance, right now I'm interested in the unique power of games as an artistic medium to portray themes of agency, choice, possibility, and control (or a lack thereof). How does giving your audience the ability to make choices within your art change its impact? Games like Slay the Princess, Disco Elysium, and Book of Hours are all great examples of stories that use player agency to develop the themes of their story. These tools simply aren't available outside of the medium of games.

Outside of class, my artistic focus over the last few years has been more on my prose writing than anything else. I feel I've become very accomplished as a writer, but sometimes I feel that my skills as an illustrator, painter, or whatever else just don't measure up. I don't want to abandon my passion for visual art; instead, I hope to bring my skills in writing and story crafting to reinvigorate my interest in comics, games, and animation to make my artistic practice something I can be proud of again.

Why do you make art?

It's a question I've been asked so many times in so many ways, and I've never quite had an answer for it. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that I've never felt it _needed_ an answer.

Why do I draw? Put a pencil in my hand and paper in front of me and it will be covered in doodles by the time class is over. I can't _stop myself_. My old chorus teacher found some of my sheet music from when I was in middle schooler and it is covered in drawings, despite our "don't draw on the sheet music since we'll use it again in future years" policy. (By the time I got to high school I could moooostly not draw in my sheet music, but I substituted it for filling in the holes inside letters.)

Why do I write fanfiction? Because my options are "imagine it and not write it down" or "imagine it and write it down". When I like a story my impulse is always to take it apart and put it back together like I'm trying to understand some antique toaster. It started when I was a little kid too hyped up on a cliffhanger in a chapter book to fall asleep, and I'd think up a simple happy resolution so I could set my thoughts to rest. As I got older my sense of character and narrative improved, and those resolutions had to be more and more complex to feel satisfying. Paying attention to stories and what makes them tick is, I think, a big part of why I've become such a good writer.

Why do I make art? Because I have to. My brain wants to make things, to tell stories, to draw pictures, to _move_ and _play_ and _create._ Art is my default setting. It takes effort to shut it off.

Jaiden Blais-Ellis is an artist who loves play. There is a beauty inherent in games, in choices, and there is a playfulness inherent in creation, in art. By focusing on play, Jaiden seeks to explore new ways of telling stories and engaging with audiences in their work. How can I invite an audience to participate in a piece, to shape the story with their choices? At the same time, how can I control a story, make a player's sense of being constrained by the narrative part of the art? How can mechanics and game design become part of a work? What is the role of fun in games-as-art, and is there a place for un-fun-ness in play?

In the Secret Histories games, the principle Moth (think of it like an element, or a category of magic) is "the perilous principle of chaos and yearning." It's called Moth because of two main associations: one, the idea of a moth flying into a flame -- "I knew a man who kept moths in a bell-jar. On nights like this he'd release them one by one to die in the candle", a quote from the games which I know by heart -- being drawn to something beautiful and destroying yourself in your approach of it; two, the idea of metamorphosis and transformation, shed skin and flight, change and growth and leaving the old behind. (It's also called Moth because of the Moth, a god who flayed the Wheel and took its place as a symbol of change and motion, but that's mostly beside the point.) It's a lovely little bundle of themes that I happen to be obsessed with; desire and desperation, self destruction, dance and motion, change and loss -- all of these are things that I love to explore in my work and in my life.

To me making art is about exploration. I want to try new things, new ideas, new techniques; I want to explore myself and the world around me; I want to discover things I never expected from a project. I love trying new mediums -- recently I've been enjoying video editing, and I've also discovered a love for sign language poetry (though I'm not particularly good at it yet). Ever since I took a water color class that almost exclusively painted outside, I find myself more aware of light and color, of shadows and form and the beauty of my surroundings. Making art is an effort to capture meaning in one way or another, and through art I can learn about the world in ways simple observation cannot capture.
