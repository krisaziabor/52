# Thisbe Wu

## 01

Thisbe Wu is an artist who is still exploring what concepts and subject matter feel most resonant to her. In the past she has predominantly been a portrait painter and printmaker. In recent years she has been experimenting with new and different mediums through her classes at Yale, which have been valuable training, but have not pointed her towards a conceptual interest or niche. She enjoys many different methods and media of artmaking and hopes to find a visual throughline between the different parts of her practice. She has recently become interested in more interdisciplinary methods of artmaking. A trained classical singer and guitarist and music director of The Yale Slavic Chorus, she is also interested in integrating music and soundwork into visual art installations. She hopes to explore more collaborative ways of artmaking as well, especially through printmaking and the camaraderie of the printshop. Above all she hopes to make art that serves her communities as well as art that contributes to social justice, although she continues to question what role art serves in social movements and how valuable it actually is.

I fell in love with linocut, woodcut, and monoprint last year. My experiments with lino and woodcut have mostly been in black and white, or using a limited color palette, and have been greatly stylistically influenced by the woodcuts of Kathe Kollwitz, Elizabeth Catlett, and Frans Masereel. I am very inspired by printmaking’s historical use in protest art, especially by those three artists, which is part of the reason why I’m so drawn to the medium. In the future I hope to expand my printmaking practice by exploring the complexities of making multicolored linocuts and woodcuts.

Recently, I’ve been making art and thinking about my maternal grandmother, who passed away in 2020 from covid. The pain and unresolved resentment and anger I have about her death have resurfaced due to trump's election. His blithe disregard for the pandemic resulted in her death and his administration's actions stand in opposition to the values that she lived by.

In this current sociopolitical hellscape, in which people’s livelihoods, human rights, and free speech are threatened by trump’s administration, I think art has an incredibly important role in resistance to these dangers.

As I continue to make work processing my grandmother’s life and death, I am negotiating how making art about my personal histories can feel widely resonant with people. I also want to work in the tradition of printmaking as protest art in response to our society’s current crises. I guess I’m grappling with the age-old question of how to meld the personal and political in my art.

Thisbe Wu is an artist from New York City currently studying Painting & Printmaking at Yale University. She works in many mediums, including painting, drawing, and printmaking. She also has extensive training in classical guitar and singing and is active in the music community at her college. As she continues developing her practice, she hopes to integrate these aspects of her artistic identity into multidisciplinary installations or performance projects. Thisbe draws inspiration from protest art and music and is also currently wrestling with the question of how overtly political she wants her art to be.
