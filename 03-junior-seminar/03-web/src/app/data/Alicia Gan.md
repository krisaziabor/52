# Alicia Gan

## 01

My name is Alicia Gan and I am a Chinese-American artist from Southern California, among other states. I am currently based in New Haven, Connecticut, where I attend Yale University as an undergraduate. I am a Junior double majoring in Art and English Literature.

My current work encompasses anything from painting, book/magazine design, contemporary dance, to writing. I value an artistic practice with both scope and simultaneity, which allows me to draw connections between mediums, and solve problems in one with the creative process of another.

At Yale, I choreograph and perform for Yaledancers, Yale's first and oldest dance company. I design and direct for The New Journal, a magazine which publishes widely on Yale and New Haven. I exhibit my paintings and drawings when I get the chance to. In my free time, I take long walks, create oddly themed Spotify playlists, and build my palette of loose leaf teas ([this](https://paruteabar.com/collections/house-blend/products/blue-chamomile) is my favorite at the moment).

Above all, I enjoy getting lost in a creative process. My current preoccupations in art are intuition, light and the way it refracts, negative space, layering, and muscle memory. My current inspirations are Rae Klein, Katherine Mansfield, and Jaclyn Royal. I feel most inspired when I am paying attention.

Alicia Gan's muse is light. From luminous acrylic paintings to sun-bleached cyanotypes, her work is not only interested in the capture, but also the continuous expression of it.

She is particularly interested in the relationship between light and absence, as exemplified by the Chinese character 光, which holds both "empty" and "luminous" as definition. It was often heard throughout her childhood to signal the finishing of one's dinner, when the plate is cleared so well that it shines.

In painting, she uses many layers and selective light washes to create an inner light on the canvas, which glows in the areas that paint is the most spare (the light ground of the canvas shining through). She is interested in pushing these material questions of opacity, absence, and layering further, whether through using translucent surfaces, an iterative process, or destruction of existing works.

My work explores objects and subjects of tension from everyday life, with emphasis on biomorphic forms and the use of the human figure as a vehicle for communication.

Art began as a meditative act for me, so my earlier pieces exhibit technical detail work, a style which trapped me entirely in the creation process. As a dancer well versed in the harsh extremes of human physicality and motion, the subtle repeating act of painting and drawing drew me in as an alternative way of physically experiencing the world. My deliberate, layer-intensive workflow aligned with this.

Over time, this style evolved, becoming incorporated into works that held more thematic weight and personal narratives. In “Open Up,” I examined conflicting cultural notions of beauty, collaging pastel and acrylic to delve into the tension between the internal and external, abstract thought and concrete reality. “Stasis” similarly contrasts biomorphic resin forms and clean graphite realism, the two meeting in an odd harmony.

My interest in organic shapes and a curvilinear aesthetic is partially inspired by the Surrealists, whose use of a realistic style to create dream-like scenes meshes with my current investigation of contradictions. The biomorphic forms of Tanguy and Dalí inspired the imagery of recent pieces, in which I challenge my prior realistic tendencies with more fluid and spontaneous shapes, an ongoing journey for me to relinquish control in art practice.

Alicia Gan is currently interested in the outline of the human form, as signaled by shadows, silhouettes, and skin. Her work explores at how the boundary between inside and outside is demarcated, what happens to our bodies when they contact one another, how tracing the contours of another's features through pencil becomes a kind of care (to this end, she is inspired by the drawn figures of Schiele and Kelly, as well as Asawa's use of wire as a line that sculpts space).

She conceives of drawing as an opportunity to explore the intimacy of the gaze, combining deliberate observation with a slow process in an effort to transcribe the world as she sees it.

These are the real settings my work often originates from:

A grove of bending trees in Afton Park, Minnesota, my backyard deck, bedroom door that cut light at strange angles, the old closet with a chartreuse wall painting of vases and teacups (leftover from previous owners), wide elementary school parking lot with a field behind it, my current bedroom covered in many maps, the grey family Toyota that was exactly the same age I was, dance studio filled with mirrors, dressing room with metallic balloons stuck by the ceiling, dentist's office with a nice river view, bedroom in China with mosquito nets and a slow central fan, the top bunk of my bed I shared with my cousin when she lived with us for a couple of years, the two square windows above our television in Ohio, last year's dorm with the scattered natural light, our backyard garden, long plain street with many water sprinklers that all went off at 8 PM

I've recently been thinking and wondering about what it means to be a figurative painter in a today's art scene. If, as Michael Fried claims in "Art and Objecthood," it is true that the common understanding today is that painting has failed to produce a direct, unmediated viewer experience, if it is true that the contemporary art world favors the immersive, abstract, installation, site-specific, and performative, if it is true that museums and galleries have long been oversaturated with paintings attempting at Van Gogh or Pollock--- does what I create have any conceptual or justifiable value?

I don't have an answer to this, aside from the faith in returning to my own process: the intimate act of tracing a profile in pencil, the exhilaration gained from the easy blending of colors into one another. As aptly said by assemblage artist John Outterbridge: “I ended up doing art simply because I felt good about the things that influenced me: the things that I saw, the things that I heard, the things that I felt, the images that you wanted to hold onto. So art became that—it wasn’t a business. It wasn’t something that you knew would create salaries. I never thought about it in that way. It was a way of saying what I felt to other people. It was also a way for me to keep a journal about the things that were close.”

With my imposter syndrome assignment, I didn't want to deliberately produce a work of art in the conventional sense (for me that would be a crafted painting or drawing), and so I had to think of alternate ways of thinking of a work of art. My work ended up being a sculpture, composed solely of the leftover makeup wipes I had used during the week of my performance, colored with foundation, eyeshadow, lipstick, and even my own eyelashes. As my imposter, the artwork I was producing every day could also be identified as the makeup I painted on my face every morning, which makes my sculpture a work of aftermath, as well as a work of accumulated time. This project got me thinking about alternate means of documentation, specifically aftermath as documentation, and the different ways that residue or fragments can be repurposed into works of art in their own right, charged with the history of their becoming.

Who are you outside of your body?

I don't know if I am anyone outside of my body, I experience the world as a necessarily embodied individual. The ways my eyes see light, how my bones respond to the cold, the coordination of my hands, all shape my internal tendencies and dreams. I suppose I could say a host of things about language, relationships, people's projections of their ideas of me onto me, but I don't feel like those things would be as true as I feel in my skin right now. Like Natalie Diaz states in her poetry, the first water is the body.

Today I made a pretty eerily accurate portrait of myself, and as I began to recognize my own face in the charcoal, I felt incredibly unsettled. I can't imagine seeing the world from eyes other than my own, and I certainly can't imagine seeing myself from someone else's eyes. I've become distrustful of mirrors and glass. I think we weren't meant to see our own faces all the time. I think our bodies are meant to be vessels for experience and I hope to be able to practice that in the future.
