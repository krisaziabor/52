Well. Let’s get started. It’s hard to select something to write about, but I guess the thing that has been on my mind recently (other than my studio assignment ._. ) is how I want to continue practicing art for the rest of my time here and after graduating. I switched from computer science to art during the spring of my sophomore year. I don’t know why, but it took me more than a month to admit that I was not enjoying what I was studying. Don’t get me wrong, I thought it was interesting, and I actually enjoyed the PSETS during CS50 or CPSC 201, but I also knew that my reasons for sticking with the major were flawed. However, even after making the switch, I refused to call myself an artist. I remember thinking to myself that I wasn’t at that level yet. BUTTT I guess, I’m past that.

I remember one of the things that I struggled with when I became an art major was deciding my concentration. I remember overthinking about it. Now, I couldn't care less. I kinda just want to do whatever I want to do in terms of creative work and even things that aren’t necessarily related to art. I’m still discovering myself, but at no point do I think that I’ll ever have a specific niche. I’m content being a jack of all trades. For now at least.

Dang, that was a ramble. I wonder what next week will bring.

For this week's artist statement, I've been thinking a lot about what role I want photography to play in my art. More specifically, how I want it to look, and how sports or movement fit into that. Lately, I’ve been questioning why I find myself drawn to certain types of photography, especially sports photography. I often find myself looking at a picture of an athlete, drenched in sweat, really pushing themselves, and I think to myself, _that's a badass shot_. But then I realize, what really grabs me isn't just the picture—it's the idea that I'd rather be someone in that position, feeling that strain and effort, instead of just photographing it.

As much as I enjoy obsessing over form and the way athletes or niche jazz musicians look in their element, what interests me most is learning how to be like them. To actually experience that level of skill and focus. I sometimes feel like if I only stay on the outside, just capturing the moment with a camera, I’ll never really understand what it’s like. I love watching athletes work out, or seeing musicians work through their craft, and I think I’ll never truly grasp that experience unless I put myself in the process.

That’s what got me thinking about photography from a first-person point of view. How can I bring myself closer to the experience I'm trying to capture? I’ve thought about using something like a GoPro or other tools, but it’s been interesting to ask myself how I can really immerse myself in the act of movement or creation, rather than just documenting it from the outside.

But then again when I watch a video of a street photographer, I get the same urge to participate that I do as the examples above.

_ANYWAYSSS,_

_still thinking, still pondering, still fucking around with stuff._

_[Original (top made pretty with chatgpt) :_

I think for this week's artist statement something that has come up to me or something that I've been focusing on a lot or questioning more so is like what role do I want photography to take in my art or how this photography look like for me and I guess in addition to that how does Sports or movement look like to me, the reason that I'm asking this is because like many times I've been… I don't know I've been thinking about like certain photography especially like sports photography and I think to myself like quote on quote that it's a good like picture, that is a badass picture, I say it's an athlete like really really sweating and really like putting in the work or like really exerting themselves and I think to myself like if one: I would much rather be doing that and then like taking a photograph of it I would much rather be in a similar pain than to just photograph it as much as I love obsessing over form as much as I love obsessing over like just how cool and athlete might look as much as I love obsessing like how cool like and Niche Jazz musicians look as cool as anything that I think of like like as much as that interests me what interests me most is like learning how to be like them in the sense that learning that skill I think if I just try to stay outside of a given work or I just try to stay I don't know if I just try like with photography for example if I just tried like for example just capturing the moment I feel like they're like I will never get close to that I will never get close to knowing what it is like especially for me someone that really enjoys looking at the process since I enjoy like looking at athletes workout little like I don't work out instead of just like racing sometimes I enjoy just seeing a musicians just like working things out and I feel like no matter what I do especially with photography I was like I can't get to that I'd like to capture I don't know that kind of got me thinking to like first person point of view for photography and how I can get to that cuz like whenever I think about that there's GoPro there's this there's that but yeah… yeah.]

NOTE TO SELF: Although it may be feasible… if you ever get stuck with a public restroom as your studio again, try to make your longest increment/session no more than an hour. My god 4 hours in a restroom is killing me right now haha. But anywaysss since my fingers are beat after trying to learn a couple of chords for the last 3 and a half hours (none have been mastered but reading chord sheets is becoming a little more familiar), I decided to take a short break and watch some guitar covers. My motivation for this was already dropping even though I literally just started a couple of hours ago. But I realized something while doing so. Those videos were even more fascinating to me now. Though I still don't know what artwork came out of this, I am glad to have finally spent some time trying to learn the guitar. I have a few voice recordings and videos from that night and it will be exciting to see how things change in the coming weeks. I have never really had the urgency to practice, but after last night, I can see why it is so necessary. My improvement won't be fast. It'll have to be subtle.

notes to self: Aside from that I think im figuring out how I want try create first person pov images... with a chest strap, my iphone, and taking a frame from a video. I also want to try some compiling some images like Pelle cass, and try the 1st pov while sparring/running/etc. Im curious to see what frames i can make with all of this

ps: im kinda treating these statements as little journals and to not overthink, imma just type and submit (for now at least),

until next time...

I truly believe everyone is an artist. Fine artist, idk. But artists, I think so. I also think anything could be "art". I just think that there will be art that resonates with you and art that doesn't resonate with you. Art that resonated but doesn't anymore and art that didn't resonate but does right now.

...

(the bottom is voice to type, i find that it helps me just let thoughts out without thinking of trying to sound correct etc)

But one of the things that I've been thinking about this week is what responsibility does an artist have to create a certain work// if there's an opportunity to create a word that can illustrate something that can help other people deserve artists have a responsibility to do so what are some of the challenges that an artist might face when trying to approach this//I've been thinking about this ever since last week's MFA photo critique// this is for early hours critique and then it was something that elle and Leor were speaking about / having a discussion about like how heavy a burden it is to kind of carry a responsibility to for the art to do something and this went beyond the photos but I think there's even something about music or some something like that and I think the whole thing of trying to help somebody else kind of feeling out of your control or capabilities is something that I feel a lot of us including myself feel//There are things that I feel the need to speak of and they're also things that I feel the need to just step away from to just let it go// So my dilemma recently has just been like does a certain art that I make have more important or less important do I really have an obligation to do that or can I really just step away from and just try to create or that has nothing to do with so and so responsibility or so and so experience or so and so analysis I guess / I remember after you could take I had to take a step back and low-key I was like there was just too many questions too many like things that I was like reconsidering that they became kind of mind-boggling and then, I don't know, going to the gym and like working out kind of help with that but then I've been returning to that question with a little bit more thoughtfulness and just readiness to like listen and readiness to question and yeah those are just some of the things that I've been thinking about I'm still discovering reconsidering thinking about what that means to me but yeah I hope that I can continue like going after this question in the coming weeks

## 05

I'm ngl, I completely forgot about this until right now. Let's see... The week before break was a tough one. I kind of used the first week of spring break to kinda just do nothing. It is very hard to do nothing but I was able to do so for that first week. I did do a lot of thinking and reflecting though. I looked at some of the work I have completed and thought to myself that there are other things I still want to try, which is a good thing. The other thing that came to mind is how in some cases I am scared to make a certain artwork because of what I will learn about myself in the process of doing so — also just trying and growing sometimes scares me. This sort of excitement but also fear is in some sense tiring. One thing I came to realize is that I am still growing. When I feel stuck, I now have more tools to combat this inactivity than I did a few years ago. I am able to check myself a bit more clearly. That has come from the belief that growth and change are always possible. Whether you believe you can or you believe you can't you are right. I saw this post a couple of weeks ago where someone commented on something a friend or therapist said in response to their question of "how can i love myself/not hate myself/do the trust myself/ or something like that" with " in trying you're already doing" or something around those lines. It kinda made me chuckle a bit. This made me reflect on what art is.

Some other things that I've thought about.

Filtered art is still art.

Placebos.

"I love you" means something different depending on who says it and who you are when you receive it.

You can only meet someone to the same level that you have met yourself?

Eating an apple in public kinda gives the same vibe of smoking a cig in public LOL

Can't hate rain if you want flowers

Also, i finished tuesdays with morrie during break and MYGOD what a book!

k i need to do this weeks artist statement now.

## 06

I've been thinking about something I've read recently. It was from _Tuesdays with Morrie_ and it was something along the lines of "people are only mean when they feel cornered". I remember last year I had a thought come up that has been on my mind every now and then since then. "For who are you when you are loved and for who are you when you are hated? If they are not the same person, I guess something has to change. Do you only love those who love you? "

I think I recently thought about this again because after I said "an eye for an eye my friend" my friend responded with " remember, an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind".

Anywaysss IDK what I'm trying to say, I just felt that all of these things connected to each other.

Some other newsss:

Something I've recently been doing with my friend is writing a haiku every time we go out. The last two times have been at Atticus and here are my two haikus.

_**Baraja de Cartas**_

One morning. One friend.

A deck of cards. Shuffle. Slap.

Fuck. I lost again.

_**Hands**_

Lots of little bones.

Can punch, wave, hold, crack and more

Hehe kinda weird

It had been a while since I wrote any poetry (since last semester, when my professor had the class go on a color walk and make an art work to reflect our walks). I'm ngl, it's pretty relaxing and sweet to read over them from time to time.

Anywaysss, time for class. WOOT WOOT

## 07

I really like Kalup Linzy's quote. It kind of reminded me of The Bee Movie hehe.

I like to think that everyone's interests, patterns, and habits contribute to their persona in some way or another. I would also agree that many times it feels like you can only be one thing in life. But no one is like that. To me, that would basically mean that everyone would always be the same person, and that is almost never the case.

I think constantly planning for the future is what creates this sense of urgency. However, I think a lot of us, including myself, fail to realize that we are already here. We are alive right now. Tomorrow is not promised and yesterday is no more. In order to free ourselves from these expectations and ourselves (in some sense) I think consistently trying to be in the present moment is important. I would also say that it is important to try to not constantly over-analyze//intellectualize everything, especially our interests.

Recently, instead of thinking I like or dislike something, I've tried to think about it more in the sense of whether I am interested or not interested at the moment. I have also tried to ignore/dismiss if something will take "TOO" long for me to master/get good at.

The time will pass anyways, right?

But anywaysss, how beautiful is it that how we experience the world and how the world experiences us is constantly changing.

**How do we imagine in new ways?**

I think the best way to do this is by trying not to question our curiosity too much. Often times I think that we feel that we know the answers to a lot of things, but honestly, that is hardly ever the case. I'm thinking about this in the sense of hobbies or relationships. Growing up, I always dismissed some activities because I used to see them as too easy, LMAO how dumb of me.

I think something that has helped with this is being stubborn in creating and looking for my own evidence for my thoughts and imagination. In other words, don't knock it till you try it type shiii. This goes with sports, artistic ideas, vulnerability, etc. Doubt your doubts.

**Who taught you how to see?**

My parents... my siblings... my friends... my teachers... my peers... my pets... strangers... the world...God?

Right now though? all of the above plus me i guess

**What is the survival value of art?**

My bad, I am confused by this question.

**What do you want to say to the future?**

"Lets hang out soon"

"I am scared no more"

"It's not your turn yet"

"Are you there"

"Wait for me"

**What is heaven?**

I've always thought about heaven as a state, not a place. Like I see the world as something with the potential to become heaven-like. Honestly, though, I am not too sure now.

**What can magic give us?**

Hope. Power. Loss. A better understanding.

**What can be learned by witnessing?**

Life exists outside of ourselves.

To just be.

To challenge.

How to go out and return or how to sit and depart.

**How do we re-imagine relation?**

By thinking of it in terms of influence. Also, something that doesn't exist together but can exist independently and together with other things simultaneously.

**What can kindness provide art?**

Love and compassion among fear and confusion.

**Who are you outside of your body?**  

A soul? An experiment? A collection? Proof?  A story?

**What is the question you seek to answer?**

"What is my truth"

"What is my role"

"What can I do"
