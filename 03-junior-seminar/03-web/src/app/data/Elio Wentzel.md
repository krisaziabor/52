The feeling of creating art envelops my being. I was raised crafting with my parents passionate in sharing making practicing, shaping education and mending ships. They teach me as I become steadfast (separately, things I am not by my genetic balance) and connected by wholehearted trust and communal love.

My room feels warm to the touch, with childhood books and soft materials finding space among expanding rainbow corners of me. Stones from the sea and hippie self-care help me breathe thoroughly bridging my cells, encompassing. Papa built Elio-shaped shelves around me and photos, art, notes from buddies pattern my walls where I can be seen.

Music lets me express myself every day and I dearly want to make fully-fledged songs, already jamming with buddies on kazoo and keys. Photographing cocreating with community, I love running lights for plays and immersing myself with the team's visions as I capture a rendition. In my art, I hope to keep close contact with home while releasing myself into each wonderful day. Sorry this is late I got pretty thrown in the midst. :P

Elio wants to you take a look, listen, hand and sit in the feeling. Their photos are taken held closely to their heart in the brief reaction of translating while noticing. Fitting into the frame feet and fingers of theirs solidifies embodiment. Elio smiles in sunlight and sashays in shadows. They practice intuitive movement after being taught specific stretches to recover repeatedly from childhood surgery. Now they swim, dance, and doodle closer to their core than ever before.

_Really cool artist statements from Power Line, Painting/Printmaking MFA Thesis Exhibition!_

**Nadia Younes** Nadia Younes is an interdisciplinary artist who investigates transitional spaces and the tension within materials, challenging both physical and perceived borders. As a Palestinian-Russian from Israel, her upbringing forced her to navigate multiple cultural frameworks, detaching from institutional and geographical pre-conceived identities. Through aesthetics, tactics, and strategic decisions, she invites a deeper engagement with the viewer’s apparatus of perception.

Her practice transforms industrial and painting materials into reconfigured forms that blur the boundaries between painting and sculpture. These forms carry a sense of agency and emotion, eliciting sensations of spillage, containment, boundaries, tactility, and gravity. In the transformation of the recognizable into the unstable, she interrogates the stability and veracity of forms.

**Purvai Rai**'s artistic exploration centers on the interplay between memory, identity, and materiality. Witnessing India's complex socio-political realities informs her process, prompting a cathartic and behavioral relationship with these stories through ritualized, repetitious, art-making processes including weaving, mark-making and printmaking. Guided by research and developed by materiality—her works function as metaphorical reflections on the ever-shifting social, political, and cultural landscape she inhabits.

**Haejin Park** melts into watercolor. Shapeless beings wrestle with cathartic colors, releasing pain and confronting shame. The vibrant bleeding slows as she captures the raw ghost that cannot lie to the self.

**Paulina Moncada** is an interdisciplinary artist interested in human language, ecosystems and time. Her work investigates quotidian scenes, animal behavior and ordinary objects that she uses as symbols, opening the viewer's gaze to new meanings. Her paintings, drawings and installations play with blurring the boundaries between the real and the impossible, the uncanny and the ordinary, the earthly and the mysterious, bringing fiction and desire into conversation.

**Rose McBurney**’s painting practice engages with the recognition of the potential for meaning to emerge from discrete confluences. Working with a degraded color palette, extracted from screenshots of strangers' home movies on YouTube, she uses thumbnails as a tool to construct cropped, economical compositions in a single layer of oil on linen. Currently, Rose is exploring paint’s ability to transition from dark to light through transparency, achieving a matte finish with oil, and examining the effects of scale, flatness, perspectival space, and the relationship between abstraction and figuration.

**Rayer Ma** is a Chinese artist. Her practice explores un-knowing as a form of knowledge through an investigation of material presence and transformation.

**Erol Scott Harris II**, I come from a lineage of laborers, my grandparents were floorers and railroad workers in Chicago when they came to the United States from Mexico. Similar to my grandparents, my body is both a tool for making and the source from which meaning arises. I am intrigued by the sculptural possibilities of vinyl sheet flooring, a synthetic material made to perfectly reproduce the look of natural stone. I work primarily with a faux marble sheet vinyl, as a metaphor for our complex human desire for physical and emotional stability. I generate vien-like surface textures by applying paint directly onto my skin and lowering myself onto the surface via ropes and pulleys. I call these impressions “smooshes”, which are often cut out and reconfigured into new shapes, often inspired by nature or geometric contrast. Through a laborious process of cutting, chopping and shearing, I create objects that often are characterized by a compact static appearance or a more open rhythmic composition. I regularly add pure, intensely colored pigments to contrast the white tonality of the faux marble. A contrast that correlates to the prolonged controversy of polychromy in Greek and Roman marble sculpture.

**Rosa Bozhkov** approaches drawing and painting as a way of thinking, wondering, and arriving somewhere unplanned. The painting is fertile ground for new meaning, rising from inconsistency, trial and error, active emptiness, and unresolved, amalgamated narrative. The materiality of paint parallels the distorting, layering, and condensing nature of recollection.

**Emily Chan** is a poet and Master of Arts and Religion candidate with the Institute of Sacred Music at Yale Divinity School. She received an MFA in poetry at the Iowa Writers’ Workshop, and is currently completing a thesis on voids. Her work has been published in the Denver Quarterly and Brooklyn Review.

It's been a while since I checked in about myself in this discussion, you all have been sharing great stuff. Late February I began to write, I want to keep shading in my shadows and show I care for their depth, and it's true, I look up and down to them as light flickers through.

Me and the ground make conscious contact since always and sometimes I decide to pick stuff up. I went to Dionne Lee's photo talk this week and was struck by our similar tendencies. She walks with a channeling stick and takes her time folding in the darkroom and pays attention to rocks and weaves string between hands. We both love plant fossils, their details and images.

Driving in the passenger seat of my buddy's car tonight I had a beautiful thought.

maybe i was color blind in a previous life

now loving colors and shadows w all my heart

I would like to make a song about this joyful appreciation, and am now learning to strum.

I have been majorly struggling on Canvas this semester, but thankfully art discussions in my life have been fulfilling, vibrant in realizing and revealing outwardly how and with what I'm grappling. Yayyy conversations with friends!!

This break I traveled the western part of Iceland with a buddy as we lovingly evolved into interdependent companions. We met through and shared two art classes in the fall, photographing and broadly visually thinking—as I experienced exhaustion late fall semester, they helped me immensely to open my CPA show in all the ways: cooking dinner, carrying materials, understanding my state. This spring of their sophomore year, they realized a gap was necessary when we spent the night walking and talking in New York going to a indie/puppet concert, a night that felt so alive and human to two people tired of endless undertakings expected of students. We stopped in the middles of blocks and exchanged photos freely. I shared how my sophomore spring held time home, navigating personal days creating closely, alongside family who I lived with and lifelong friends, and particularly shedding presentational layers, free to be myself without double-thinking how people perceived me. We drove up the North coast, around mossy volcanic ridges through snowy mountains to the south of the island. We started the trip often living for the camera, discussing what it felt like to approach and then make an image bursting with life. My mind drifted and focused in practicing presence, leaving behind the camera and openly choosing moments to translate myself through a lens, gaining comfort with how it felt and what it meant. My whole body bounced, breathing and believing joyous.

The world Nat and I experienced together is breathtaking and stoking and vast; we held each other’s hands leaning and leading at many places, and I am so grateful to share it.

**Today I am inspired by the variety of artists, methods, and conversations Elle posted. From Sophie Calle’s drawer of lost things as future ideas, I considered how I juggle special things and make collections on the limited floor of my room, making decisions to keep based on how they feel to be around and, last night, moving on from a lot of recycling. On New Year, Papa burned a fire taller than him of wood he hoped to repurpose, coming to better terms with fulfilling projects and material he considers dear. Amalia Ulman’s Instagram archives are fabulous, and so is her audience: on a post captioned, “**Messy bun, computer, tea and bed kinda day ##secretsociety123” I @colleenknows responds “You are fascinating.” The internet can be rich in sharing updates and, moving past posting-block, I find comforting nostalgia forming carousels of days and friends for me and my buddies to look back on, adding a soundtrack that encapsulates each memory remotely. Once on Youtube watching ART THOUGHTZ (rad and insightful)**, I was pulled into Kendrick Lamar’s performances. “i” (introed by Woody Harrelson on SNL) burned alight with passion and depth, his movement feeling as a beautiful combination of premeditation and free spirit. I complete this statement with Kendrick and Wesley Theory rocking To Pimp A Butterfly live @Austin City Limits (Must see!!!!), his hands often signing so powerfully they encourage a whole language of reciprocation in the crowd. Kendrick’s artistry has me motivated to see chance when repetition strikes, to create art for a feeling, instantaneous in a jam, layering as my life blossoms and meets more life. Jesus’ reminder to not read into interest rings true, and last night my mom added to let each thought be a visitor welcomed at the door, though they need not stay. Looking ahead art my week, I am glad to be on track enough to be excited for opportunities, like the spring Oye showcase, creating under the theme Rain Songs. I think I will be brave and make a song!! [Come](https://yaleconnect.yale.edu/oyesw/rsvp_boot?id=2295854) by :)**
