# Kai Zhang

## 01

My name is Kai, an illustrator, zine-maker, and artist from Queens, New York. Currently based in New Haven, Connecticut, I am attending Yale University studying Computing and the Arts, where I’ve taken numerous classes expanding my design skillset and artistic practice.

I’ve shifted through various forms from graphic design to printmaking to comics, yet throughout all of these different mediums, I try to focus on themes that connect with my personal identity through culture and community. I often find myself using art as a vessel for sharing the stories that I have a hard time telling through spoken word, and the ability to put words, images, and ideas onto paper, screen, and any other materials to share my own personal message is truly a special task to honor.

I sometimes have a hard time connecting with the title of artist. I hesitate when I say I am an artist because, to be honest, I have trouble understanding what I am actually doing. What is my practice? Do I even have one? What am I trying to say? Instead, I simplify the idea to saying that I like to make things. And there’s a whole lot of things that I hope to make.

My name is Kai, an illustrator, zine-maker, and artist from Queens, New York. In my work, I’ve been exploring the ideas of space and time through various mediums from comics to linocut printmaking. I’ve been trying to grapple with the intersection between my cultural and social identity and bringing them more into my work. I’m sometimes confused by what I should be doing, forcing myself to think in one way because I should be, while trying to maintain the level of freedom and fluidity to explore and not be so regimented in my thoughts and practice.

In the recent days, I’ve come across various artists who have inspired me greatly – [those](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/chris-hoffmann-digital-art-240920) that create the absurd and weird, [those](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/person918x-digital-200220) that have the main goal of making art for the internet to stumble upon, and [those](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/patrick-kyle-220217) that work with a state of spontaneity. I’ve been brought up with the idea that the work I make should ultimately be a representation of my own experiences, truths, and reflections – which reminds me that I also need to be making time to investigate new experiences, seek unspoken truths, and practice reflections. Sometimes I feel stagnant, limited in my scope of what is possible. As an “artist”, I want to be able to imagine new possibilities and take pride in that imagination.

I make art as a way to express the unresolved. Many times I make with the intent of sharing my personal history and the way I try to see this world from a multitude of perspectives. As an Chinese American, I try to incorporate the lessons I’ve learned from a culture that is built on family ties and making our voices heard. As someone who is an introvert, I try to explore the internal struggles of wanting to fill in the social gaps that I lack. As someone who works to be an optimist, I have a belief that dreams can become reality when I prioritize my imagination and work patiently with what my mind offers. These are some of the identities and experiences that I try to merge in my art practice, figuring out who I am with each project that I create.

I’m also looking to confront feelings of shame in my artwork too. I hope to dive into questions of what does shame mean? In the recent months, much of my thoughts have revolved around this emotion, feeling doubtful of what I’m doing and experiencing a deep mental turmoil about who I am and how I want to be seen. Through my work, I want to explore and expose this feeling more, understanding the nature of our personal identities and the complexities that come with a fear of being seen, yet wanting to be heard.

I think of an artist as a way of developing one’s sensitivity to the world. An artist observes the slightest changes and feels deeply, using their sensitivity and appreciation to develop their work. I find myself struggling with being an artist, especially because I have felt numb to experiences and have lacked confidence in my own self to create. I often think of the artist as someone highly sophisticated, able to explain themselves and their ideas, defending and upholding their work through critique and feedback. There’s a collaborative standard that comes with people connecting over a work, sharing ways on improving a section, swapping a different technique, or changing their mental framework. I often find the artist to be argumentative and confrontational, in the sense that they stand up for what they believe and the work they create. I feel that I sometimes lack that firm defensive stance. Many times I do feel as though I create for creation sake, and I wonder what kind of meaning I can derive from the works I produce. I realize that there is a whole of lot of learning and growth that I feel I need to do as an artist, navigating creative spaces and shaping my identity.

One of my favorite graphic novelist is Gene Yang, an educator, cartoonist, and programmer. A lot of his work with _American Born Chinese_ and _Level Up_ reonsated strong with me, many of which tackle temes of identity, culture, and belonging. His stories,whether it’s about a monkey god or a fourteen-year-old immigrant teen, jump between imaginative boundaries, yet they all are bounded on the ideas of trying to figure oneself out and understanding out why one matters. I also discovered the works of the photograph Alec Soth last semester. In his body of photographs, he captures much of the human spirit and what it means to be human when the world tries to put a label onto you. A lot of his process is to have people be acknowledged – to have their worries, fears, and doubts be seen and in doing so, feel a little less alone in this world. Both Gene Yand and Alec Soth offer that kind of solace to me. There is a feeling of being seen, of knowing that someone’s art out there connects deeply with my own trauma, guilt, and growth. That connection to me is what makes art so special to me.

There is a graphic novel titled “Here” by comic artist Richard McGuire that I am deeply moved by. It tells the story of a single space that was once the sleeping ground for dinosaurs, then a camp for Native Americans, and then a house built for a loving family. It collapses time and space, showing us the inhabitants that have lived within the place for hundreds of years. When I read the graphic novel, I’m often reminded of the places that we once inhabited, who came before us and who will follow our footsteps. “Life has a flair for rhyming events,” says McGuire. I believe that much of my life is a rhyming reflection of my parents. The worries and struggles that I face are also a part of the identity that generations before me have also had to grapple with. The idea of how ephemeral human life in contrast to the relative permanence of place is an interesting concept to grasp. _Here_ speaks to the spaces that hold echoes of memories – discussing about the births, conversations, celebrations, and deaths that mark a place. These are traces that are left behind and evoke a sense of longing for the past. Through my work, I hope to discover and reflect on these ideas of memory, longing, and change.

With the current imposter syndrome assignment that we’ve been working on, I’ve been experimenting with the ideas of becoming someone that I’m not. As someone who battles with his own imposter syndrome, I feel as though this assignment was a practice of authenticity, putting on a character and observing myself through that lens. Much of my imposter syndrome comes from a feeling of not being good enough or what I make isn’t even all that interesting or important. There comes a point where I feel afraid of being exposed for what I’m doing. However, I’ve been trying to perform a mental shift of being proud of my weirdness, and this assignment helped to unlock a part of that. I was setting up to be an ASMR food creator and being someone that isn’t afraid to express themselves about the things they enjoy. It was a very interesting experience to partake as I tried to understand who I was and putting myself in the headspace of someone who is unapologetic about their weirdness.

What can be learned by witnessing?

One of my favorite things to do is to simply people watch. When I sit down at a park bench, I enjoy the comfort of gazing at the world in front me, and what I see is a sense of everyday awe. There are people competitively playing a game of pickup basketball, while an elderly couple is walking hand-in-hand through a pathway. I can smell the scent of foxtails and feel the soft breeze of the wind on my skin. Time moves just a bit slower as I try to take it all in – and witnessing all my senses come alive. I find it so mesmerizing to witness the world in that way. There’s so much to feel, hear, and see. I find that it teaches me to take in the details. I’m keen on using my senses a little more deliberately and diligently because I don’t want to miss anything.

There’s a word in Japanese known as "Komorebi" (木漏れ日). It describes the dappled sunlight that is filtered through the leaves of a tree, often evoking a sense of tranquility and wonder. I crave moments when I can witness such a scenery, deeply witnessing the splendid magic of the world – like how trees and light interact, how people move around, or how we express ourselves to one another.
