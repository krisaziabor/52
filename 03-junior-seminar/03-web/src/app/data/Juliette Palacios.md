Last week I contracted Norovirus. I was weak and unable to work for three days. In my awareness of my limitations, I was reminded of Henri Matisse. I had first learned of Matisse in middle school when I assisted my mom in her elementary school art summer camp. In his later years, when he could no longer paint with ease, Matisse adapted to his physical decline by creating his famous cut-outs, "drawing with scissors.” Great art is sometimes born out of necessity; creativity can thrive within constraints. Beauty can come from that positionally.

Similarly, I recalled how Joseph Pilates developed his exercise method while lacking resources in an internment camp and how he used beds and springs to create reformer pilates. His story, like Matisse’s, reminded me how adversity can shape innovation. If I had been confined to my couch longer, I imagined how I might explore abstract watercolor painting, translating my nausea and irritation into such forms. I could not engage with technology at all—looking at a screen only made me sicker.

Reflecting on this experience of illness, I find that it also forced me to rethink my plans for my artist studio assignment. Originally, I intended to explore a nightclub as my studio via Toads, but since I was self quarantining and Toads does not throw parties every night, I’ll go to a bar four nights this week instead.

Indeed, the limitations imposed upon me by my illness provided me another insight and parallel. The assignment of creating art in an elevator, bus, IKEA, club, etc is similar. The idea plays with creating beauty and meaning within constraints.

My theme this week was certainly the insight of innovation through constraint– although having an infinite budget, time, and resources could be a whole lot of fun as well!

When I was in Haas Library for our “Explaining Myself” project I found a book by Paolo Ventura called _Short Stories_. Unsurprisingly, it is a series of short stories, but the twist to me is that these stories are told via photographs only–so without any writing except for the titles. To me this is reminiscent of storybooks with pictures that I would read as a child. Ventura does preface his book though, explaining that he found himself “inventing stories and escaping to [his] imaginary world,” just as he did when he was a boy. He also writes that his process involved turning a room with a skylight into a small stage with painted backdrops.

It is all very playful and youthful. Particularly I enjoy the story titled _The Birdwatcher_ where his son and him are birdwatching together, and he lifts his son up to fly. The next photograph is a painting of his son in the sky flying with the birds. This is a beautiful moment to me because so many children imagine themselves having the power to fly, which makes this story both relatable and easy to follow.

This definitely had an influence on my “artist studio” assignment. My vision for this project changed many times, but my finalized vision was to use a series of many photographs taken at the nightclub to tell a stop-motion story. I am almost done with my final piece, but after revisiting Ventura’s stories for inspiration, one thing I really want to spend more time on is coming up with the name for my project. Ventura’s short stories have titles that set the reader up for a clear interpretation of what is happening. I think this is especially important to do in my project as well. Due to the nature of a video being set at a predetermined speed– where the viewer’s “pausing agency” is not as strong as it would be if they were to be reading a book and physically flipping the pages themselves– having a title is important in illuminating the story to follow. This will allow the viewer to focus more on the general content and less on trying to figure out the premise.

Going forward I would like to continue storytelling in different forms. Perhaps next week (or at another time in the near future) I might pull inspiration even more directly from Ventura and create a short storybook using photography.

I have been reflecting recently about live art documentation. It started off with the ideas surrounding whether or not to video a live performance, specifically dance. Trisha Brown, an American post-modern dancer and choreographer, had an interesting biography written about her where the author wrote about her concept of the “ephemeral nature of dance.” Some of the beauty of performance art is that it can be done in one way only once, so it cannot be exactly replicated again. I like how this inherently creates a situation where– especially if they are aware it is not being recorded– those experiencing the performance need to live more in the present moment. There is more of a responsibility to take in as much as possible of the live performance because it cannot be reviewed again later except in the form of a mental memory (not a digital one).

However, there are significant benefits of documenting and being able to revisit video documentation at a later time. I think for this I want to try some mixtures between performance art with and without archival documentation. I would also like to experiment with different forms of documentation. It might not need to be videos or photos, but later on a drawing of the performance. This could actually cause me to be able to both reflect more on the performance and take it in vividly in the moment.

So how does this affect my art? I think for my art I need to be more mindful of when I am doing something ‘archival.’ I must be mindful that the journey of creating art can be as creative as the final destination or product. It could be argued that most non-live artforms are archival, including painting, photography, writing, etc. But what I am referring to here is wanting to find a balance between feeling like I am living presently and in the moment and having some physical forms of documentation in my artwork that I can revisit later. Examples of capturing the art of creating: when I look at my sketches and notes, it helps me relive my moments of inspiration and hard work. When I hear the story behind a famous or great art creation, the story to me becomes part of the greatness of the corpus of the art. And sometimes, the documentation of the creating of the art is just as artful or more. For example, a few years ago,  footage was found of the Beatles creating songs such as “Get Back.” _The Beatles: Get Back_ (2021), directed by Peter Jackson showcases the band's creative process during the making of their album _Let It Be_ using restored footage from 1969. Viewers see glimpses of the step-by-steps, some moments of draft-by-draft, scenes of being stumped, trying something out, struggling, thinking, pivoting, and then the clicking nirvana moments of finding it. Seeing genius art be made is pure artistry in action.

This past week, I have been wrestling with the dilemma of audio choices. I am being concerned and cautious because slight differences in audio choices would significantly alter the tone and messaging of the work. Old fashioned music from the 20’s might give the piece a retro, comical feel. Fast jazz might provide a tempo of class, and this is a choice I am considering. Hip hop would provide a contemporary feel to it.

The artistic choices behind creation are truly fascinating. It reminds me that artists must make difficult choices of commission and omission. A famous saying in screenwriting books is “kill your babies,” which means sometimes you have to let go of things you love because it might not fit in the piece. “Left on the editing room floor” is another phrase and part of the process. Difficult artistic decisions need to be made. It is the duty of the artist.

To help me get to the right decision, I have found a wonderful process is to “rewrite” or conduct many, many drafts or rewrites. To borrow a phrase from professional writers: “great writing is rewriting.” And to that end, I will continue to select, insert, try out, and experiment with what the right sound should be so that the music enhances the story and strikes the proper tone.

This week I am working on a performance art piece that relates storytelling to a 3-minute dance that is inspired by the environment that it will be performed in. My initial thoughts were to have the dance somewhere near JE Residential College. Right now the dance will be performed on the steps of the school of architecture near Haas Library. I envision moving down the steps as a way to convey movement through time in a story. Going towards the viewer (which is down the steps) will be going forward in time, while going backwards will be going backwards in time. I started choreographing this partner dance a few weeks ago, and since then it has been performed in a studio and in a snowy forest in the Berkshires.

With this dance I am trying to convey is about a partnership where the people meet, they become close, but they are careful to find a balance where they are able to maintain their individuality and strengths but also work together: the idea that 1+1=3.

I am making this piece to demonstrate the power of individuality, but also the importance of togetherness. My hope is that meaning comes across, but it is open to the viewer to take away their own interpretations.

That being said, my dance is a work in progress and could still change.

Over spring break, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Rome and see beautiful ancient art in the city of Rome. As you walk the old streets, just the architecture of the buildings is amazing. Each ancient building tells a story.

In particular, I was struck by the beauty of open windows with clotheslines hanging out to dry. Of course, there are the beautiful historic places in Rome, such as the Coliseum and the Vatican museum. But walking the streets of old Rome, I was struck as to how different and how beautiful the practice of drying clothes outside a window on clotheslines on a second, third or fourth story building.

The old buildings are multi-storied, sometimes four or five stories tall. They are finished in earth-tone hues of smooth, old-world plaster. Often the earth-tone plaster is contrasted by old wooden shutters. Dark brown or forest green shutters add to function and rustic charm.

I imagine the stories:

What families live in these old buildings? What are they drying? How long has this custom existed? Do they realize how beautiful and charming it is?

Upon further research, I learned many artists have painted these scenes. Van Gogh has shutters in some of his works.

Artists often paint the shutters of Rome because they are an iconic part of the city's visual charm and cultural history.

The weathered wooden shutters are a stark artistic contrast against the warm, sunlit smooth plaster on Roman buildings.

The bumpy layers of peeling paint, rust, and aging wood tell a story of time and history.

Many shutters are closed. Closed shutters evoke mystery and privacy, while open ones suggest life and movement.

Artists are drawn to the poetry of these small details this urban landscapes, turning something as simple as a window shutter into a work of art that reflects the specialness of Rome.

Part of my story is that this class has helped me be more aware of what stories lie behind meaningful art.

And it is wonderful these new ways of observing are becoming part of the story of my art journey.

For this week’s artist statement, I wanted to reflect on my imposter project. I had contemplated being a fake food critic– a micro-blogger who reviewed local eating establishments. However, I decided I wanted to stretch, grow, and go outside my comfort zone. I do not know much about wine, except organic wine sometimes tastes better because of the lack of pesticides, and that wine can be unbalanced if it has too many peaks.

In my research, I learned most wines are judged on wine panels or they are judged in private by wine reviewers, critics that work for publications, or by a growing cadre of wine-critic bloggers/influencers. A minority of wines are judged at a public restaurant. However, for visual content, many wine bloggers/influencers do go to public establishments to film and chronicle their tasting. And so, that became my plan and role: I was to be a popular, underground wine blogger-influencer.

I was in Italy, so I researched popular local wine bars. I showed up with my notepad and pen. I asked the waiter probing questions about the wines they had on their menu. The goal was to say just enough to make him wonder why I was asking questions and making notes. For me, part of the art of being an imposter is to engage and chronicle the reactions of those around me. Of course, one could be an imposter without others being around and one could write about those insights, such as how acting as something, being in character, one can lose oneself in the character. And, indeed, I really got into character; I talked and thought like a wine critic. But beyond just having an impact on myself, I wanted my wine critic character to have an impact on those around me, such as patrons at a nearby table or especially the server.

And indeed, it did: my careful note taking; the way I held the wine glass into the light; the way I swirled the glass around.  All those did catch his attention (maybe he was confused because maybe he did not know whether or not to believe me)– especially the sipping and then note taking.

The idea of the combination between art and empathy interests me this week, following the prompt, “What can kindness provide art?” To answer this question, I am first going to consider it the opposite way around: what can art provide kindness? I have done some research on the relationship between EQ (empathy ability) and IQ (reasoning ability). In this research I found that some important facilitators of empathy are storytelling in the classroom, storytelling using transhuman technology, and documentary narratives. Additionally, I read something for another class recently called Choreographing Empathy by Susan Forester, which talked about how to choreograph empathy using “specific physicality” to drive further connection between the performer and the audience. So I know what art can provide kindness: it can increase empathy, which can lead to acts of kindness.

But what can kindness provide art, and how can kindness and art be a feedback loop for each other? Kindness fosters respect, caring,and  open mindedness. When you look through those lenses, it opens up a wonderful way of looking at things where people can feel more inclined to let themselves feel free to be more vulnerable, creative, and feel a strong sense of purpose in their work.

Kindness and art can also generate a powerful feedback loop. When kindness is present, the artwork can have more emotional depth, which in turn can foster more empathy and kindness.

I have not yet done a traditional artist statement, so here it goes:

My name is Juliette Palacios and I am a junior at Yale double majoring in Art and Economics. In my work, I have explored painting, photography, and moving images. I try to combine personal experience, social commentary, and fantasy to tell stories through my art that will have an effect on people–whether that is in a serious, playful, relatable, or unrelatable way. Previous art of mine has gone in many different directions, but this semester I have focused my approach on wanting to create a strong, meaningful story to tell within every piece I create.

I do what I do because I love the creative freedom that comes from expressing myself in these forms, and because it is a way to organize your curiosities and translate them into a form where they can be connected with others. Being an artist lets me explore the world in a way that is both more intentional and magical–whether that is walking through a foreign city as an imposter wine critic or constructing a 5-minute stop motion silent film in the corner of Old Heidi’s. This class has helped me grow by extending my creativity for what I thought I would create.

My advice to myself and others is to 1) take the time to come up with a clear vision for what you are going to create and why and 2) take an art class that gives strange projects so that when you’re doing something embarrassing or wild in public, you can blame it on “your class assignment.”
