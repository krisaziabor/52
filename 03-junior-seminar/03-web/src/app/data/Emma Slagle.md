# Emma Slagle

## 01

Emma Slagle is an illustrator and graphic artist currently based in New Haven, Connecticut. Raised on Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi, she draws inspiration from her roots and the contemporary art scene in Hawaiʻi, as well as from her surroundings and peers at the Yale School of Art, where she takes classes as an undergraduate at Yale University.

In her junior year, Emma is studying Computing and the Arts, a unique combined major of Computer Science and Visual Art, while pursuing a language certificate in the German language. Outside of her studies, she enjoys working as House Staff at Yale’s Native American Cultural Center and serving as Co-President of Yale’s Chapter of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society.

Her practice spans graphite, watercolor, digital illustration, and graphic design, with an interest in typography and poster design. She enjoys challenges, the mundane, and exploring how technology can create art and how art can shape technology.

Her wishes for the future include continuous learning, currently in computer graphics and UI/UX design, and continuous exploration.

After trying to write something substantial and meaningful for this assignment and liking none of it, this week, my artist statement will be a visual one in the form of emojis that I think represent my current artistic process, overall inspirations, and recent works.

Emma Slagle is thinking about food and history. These past two weeks, she’s been working on a project that involves both—an all-time favorite recipe book. Battling her relentless need to collect and document everything, often to an exhaustive and overwhelming degree, the impermanence of food, one moment there, the next digested, lies an interesting counterbalance. Food resists archival. It’s refreshing, ephemeral, and intimately and joyfully personal.

This week, her focus has been on the beauty of food, its sensory details, vibrancy, shape, color, and textures—the way a warm roast beef sandwich melts into your hand and the blooming indigo stain of a rogue blueberry on a white t-shirt. Momentary pieces of art. The way food interacts with touch, movement, and memory has been a tangible source of inspiration.

She wishes to continue to explore color, shape, and texture drawn from the organic to greater extremes in the future and to further indulge in labors of love that aren’t just focused on preservation and prolificacy, but on experience—cooking, eating, sharing, and recipe-making.

I had a note on what I wanted to focus on for this round of statements, but I couldn’t find it in my iPhone notes or my notebook. So instead, I’ll talk about my notebook itself.

My notebook was a gift two Christmases ago from my friend Jaimie. It’s from the MoMA, and sprawled across the cover is a lovely Claude Monet painting. This is my notebook. There are many like it, but this one is mine. My notebook creed.

I attempt to use every blank space in my notebook. A challenge, a habit, a compulsion, maybe all three, but I think what I like most is the textures habitual usage of a book creates and the visible imprint of sustained effort in a single space. I file almost everything in it—doodles, ornithology notes, language vocabulary lists, project sketches, interview takeaways—you name it. I first write in pencil, and when the page fills and the information within that wall of graphite is no longer useful, I overwrite in ink, pressing hard to ensure the jet black cuts through the gray. It gets used at least twice over.

Some pages are dense, some still with room to spare, but none are untouched. I look forward to the day it retires and I can revisit it like an old conversation. I think this habit reflects how I'd like to continue creating—never quite starting from scratch, continuously building on what’s already there.

One of my New Year's resolutions was to read every day. I’m shooting to finish at least ten books, and I’m currently on my second, _Even Cowgirls Get the Blues_ by Tom Robbins, who, sadly, passed away this month. It’s comfortable, and I’ve been noting passages I like while I read. Here’s one I’ve saved:

“Sounds travel through space long after their wave patterns have ceased to be detectable by the human ear; some cut right through the ionosphere and barrel on out into the cosmic heartland, while others bounce around, eventually being absorbed into the vibratory fields of earthly barriers, but in neither case does the energy succumb; it goes on forever — which is why we, each of us, should take pains to make sweet notes.” (_Even Cowgirls Get the Blues_, p. 129)

Lately, I’ve been thinking about this in terms of my own creative process—what I make, what I put out there, and how those things might linger.

Lately, I’ve been filled with a lot of joy and gratitude for small details and simple things—it makes me feel a little stupid honestly to delight in actual nothingness, like the utility of a flatbed or the novelty of cursive handwriting in this age, as if I can _only_ enjoy what’s in front of me instead of ruminating on larger philosophical questions or whatnot, but I don’t care because I’m having fun.

I wrote a gratitude list on the train the other day, and it was kind of beautiful how I couldn’t stop writing it even after I put my pencil down—I just kept thinking of things I was thankful for, grateful to encounter. I know this isn’t a unique experience, and I’m glad it isn’t. It made focusing on homework a little difficult after since I kept getting distracted by my own thoughts, but I was grateful for my homework too.

I can’t say what this artist statement is supposed to show uniquely about myself or my art, but I guess something that powers me and my work is gratitude. Since a lot of people are incorporating quotes into their responses, which I’ve been enjoying reading, here’s one I’m grateful for!:

“For you, sir, may the jaws of death have cotton teeth.” – _Jitterbug Perfume_ by Tom Robbins.

Three things I’ve been thinking about while responding to this prompt: Kalup Linzy, Death, and Last Meals. I’ve been having “art block, so here’s what I’d have for my last meal (less focused on the death aspect, more so on cherished meals): For me, I’d enjoy a poppy dressing salad with candied walnuts, feta, and cranberries, then L&L’s chicken katsu plate with white rice, mac salad, and two andagi, and end strong with a warm Cinnabon roll and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

Who taught you how to see?

My mom didn't particularly practice art, and my dad definitely did not, but my Grandfather, my dad’s dad, dreamt of being an animator for Disney Studios.

My Uncle, his son, got his first tattoo at 18 in the Navy and has collected many more since. He told me: “...most have faded though because we used the wrong type of ink. Dude [aka, the guy who tattooed him] made a gun from a can opener motor and coat hanger.” That was that.

When my grandfather was in his late 50s to try to understand why his son had such an affinity for them, he got a horsefly about the size of a quarter tattooed on his calf. Why the horsefly, I don’t particularly know, and I don’t think he knows either. I think it was from the flash sheets. When I get a tattoo though, a horsefly on my calf will be first. I hold that story pretty sacred. My dad’s side of the family is all very funny like that.

Instead of an animator, after figuring out it’d mostly be busy work starting as an Inbetweener (coloring in the grass), and the only way to climb the ranks was for a Keyframer above him to die (his words), he instead worked in his father’s print shop. He was a great artist, and on the side continued to draw, doing a few illustrations and graphics for local events and organizations in the town where he lived in Illinois.

I really look up to him and my dad’s family, and he always encouraged me to continue practicing art. They teach me how to live and see.

Lately, I’ve been feeling a little amiss, but something I’ve found grounding (and want to keep practicing) are these artist statements. Like Kris’ desire to organize his archive as a remedy for the Sunday scaries, I’d like to try writing an artist statement each week, as if class were still in session, as a kind of medicine. They’ve been challenging from the start, in figuring out what to say and where to begin, but they’ve also brought a lot of clarity. Writing them forces me to slow down, reflect, and revisit the “whys” behind what I do, something I don’t often get space to consider.

I’ve also been enjoying the act of writing. One of my New Year’s resolutions was to be more concise with my words, and these statements have helped me stay conscious of that. Keep chugging on.
