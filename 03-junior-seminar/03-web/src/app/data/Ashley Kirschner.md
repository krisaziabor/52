Dear art viewer,

My name is Ashley Kirschner, and I am an art maker. That is a claim I believe anybody can make, and somewhere within my overcrowded Google Calendar, I really enjoy being creative. It’s an opportunity to shut out the obnoxious voices of our world telling us to be more or do more, since we are always coming up short of our expectations. With art, you can call it finished at any moment. Then, six months later retract your statement and start and stop all over again. This seems like the normal human rhythm of setting goals with hopes of growing, but are we ever truly done growing?

Regardless, I spend most of my practice in the digital world of graphic design and photography. By training, I am nothing more than a granddaughter of a watercolor painter who finds satisfaction in balanced composition and an aesthetically soothing neutral color palette. By joy, I am studying graphic design at the Yale School of Art as an undergraduate student and play on the Yale Women’s Soccer team. I am constantly searching to define the intersection between my deep-rooted Christian faith, sport, and my design practice. I ask questions of how or why we search for belonging and what defines a home. I challenge the boundaries of what graphic design entails by both scrapbooking and creating social media graphics for Yale Athletics within the same day. I am searching for what story I have to offer to the world, while also trying to be okay finding that out along the way. I am an artist who is simultaneously finding herself while you find my work. Through all this, I am still building blanket forts, hugging trees, and dancing in the rain—and those are the things that matter most.

Xoxo, Ashley the artist

Ashley Kirschner is a graphic designer and photographer currently based in New Haven, Connecticut. Raised in the mountains an hour outside of Seattle, Washington, she gravitates towards creating art based on her love for nature and the simplicity of a remote home. A cottage in the woods shaped her youth art practice with a grandmother who crafted weekly art challenges for Ashley and her siblings. After spending hours climbing evergreens and making mudpies, Ashley grew to appreciate the organization and structure of design while preserving memory in photography.

Outside of her time studying art at Yale, Ashley enjoys cooking, baking, reading, journaling, and playing the ukulele. She also is on the Yale Women’s Soccer team, which inspires her to search for the intersection between sport and design. She is currently employed as an intern for Yale Athletics Creative Services team where she helps create social media templates and graphics for marketing sporting events, awards, and holidays.

Today, Ashley works from the studio of her little white IKEA desk within her college apartment, but dreams of a day where she can design a room in her home to spark motivation everywhere she turns. She hopes her future finds a cross section of her passions for her faith, family, sport, graphic design, interior design, photography, and searching for her artist voice. Ashley is an artist that is ready to be formed by the world: new to her attempt at finding her own voice, but familiar to the practice of creating.

The digital medium cannot be defined. Practically, I may be creating marketing campaigns or really awesome looking finals presentations. Abstractly, I may be trying to redefine where technology limits or advances the parameters of a composition. I find the challenge of graphic design amusing. You can never really define the medium. You are never sure what counts or does not count in the category. And most of all, the internet is ever changing, so you must stay adaptable to adjust working methods at any moment.

Take painting as an example. Your toolkit feels consistent: your favorite set of brushes, mathematical mixtures of pigments to make the exact color, a canvas of choice. There seems to only be a short list of changing variables, the idea of the work being one of them. In contrast, graphic design would be done in so many ways that is can often be overwhelming to begin with.

At a young age, I found my escape in craft-making: collage, writing and telling stories, bullet journaling, and yearbook layout design. I began to find satisfaction in balance and composition. In how one minor tweak in the placement of an element could turn one’s interpretation down an unintended track. I find beauty in the art of storytelling—still struggling with what exact skills or personality traits make up the best storytellers I know. My grandfather has a way of asking the difficult life choices that pulls you into his tone, while my brother-in-law take s amore theatrical approach usually accompanied by turning napkin holders into props for his story at the dinner table.

Regardless, I believe graphic design is all an attempt to marry our ever-evolving digital world with the need to tell a story. It is an art of adhering to another person’s needs and creating concepts behind the message. It sounds so simple on paper. But maybe that is the exact issue with it. How do you do or be simple?

The following are questions I have about the world:

Why was I created? How do things get their names? Like a sandwich? Is a hotdog a sandwich? How convinced are the weather people when they predict the upcoming week? Is mother nature real? What makes things smell the way they do? Does God have a sense of smell? Does God experience senses like we do if He is not human? How would He know how to create things then? What do our dreams mean? Are all dreams significant or are some strictly for humor or pleasure? Why do people enjoy scary movies? What makes sourdough loaves look different? Is every sunset actually unique to each other? How long would it take to count grains of sand or stars in the sky or hairs on our head? How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop? Do I miss the west coast? Do I enjoy the season of life that I am in? What have I been learning recently? When will time slow down? How many days do I have left on this earth? Have I already met my husband? Have I met all the people that will be in my wedding party? What state of matter is fire? Or is it an outcome of a chemical reaction and not a state of matter at all? How many days until spring break or summer vacation? How can I get fitter? How do I always get schoolwork done on time? What is turbulence on a plane? How do planes even fly? How do birds fly? What animals look at humans and laugh? Do hummingbirds see us in slow motion? What is the next large historical moment coming our way? What is home? Who is home? Can I catch a break? What does it mean to rest? How do you rest? What is the science behind the release of crying? What will my life look like in one year? Five years? Ten years? Fifty years? Will I be proud of the life that I have built? How does this experience at Yale play into it?

Artist Statement Five:

The idea of an influencer is a title or job description that feels unique to my generation. I am not really sure how to define an influencer beyond the realm of inspiration or someone people in this world listen to, but nonetheless, I believe everyone is influenced. Therefore, to get to know me as a person beyond my art, I am going to tell you a list of things I am influenced by.

I am influenced by my little house I grew up in within the mountains of the Pacific Northwest. I am influenced by a really good smoothie on a hot summer day. I am influenced by a hard puzzle and brain games. I am influenced by my grandmothers who have so many cool creative hobbies and love their families well. I am influenced by my brother-in-law’s musical abilities. I am influenced by a spectacular new song and new music Fridays on Apple Music. I am influenced by Food Network TV shows and recipes I find on Tik Tok. I am influenced by my dad’s words: “I am proud of you.” I am influenced by the feeling of freshly shaved legs on clean sheets. I am influenced by my sister’s servant heart. I am influenced by my ever-growing and ever-evolving Pinterest boards. I am influenced by spending time reading the Bible. I am influenced by advice from my closest friends. I am influenced by the stillness in a sunset. I am influenced by a warm bowl of fresh pasta. I am influenced by making strangers smile. I am influenced by my dreams and the imaginative plot lines within them. I am influenced by those that have walked this life before me, messed up, and reminded me that there needs to be rain before a plant can bloom and be harvested. I am influenced by the simple, mundane, and beautiful moments that I will remember this life for.

My name is Ashley Kirschner, and I am a self-proclaimed artist, mostly because I am studying art with a concentration in graphic design at Yale University. I am twenty years old and live in a confusing state of life. I do not know if it is accurate to call New Haven home, mostly because I know it is a temporary residence limited to my college years. I grew up 45 minutes east of Seattle, Washington in a small little house in the woods on the outskirts of a town named Issaquah. However, that home no longer exists either because my parents moved to Charlotte, North Carolina in the Spring of 2023. Charlotte, though, also cannot be classified as home because my parents are moving again to Nashville, TN right now as we speak. So in summary, I am from Issaquah, Washington but go to school in New Haven, Connecticut but now go home to Nashville, Tennessee to a house I have never seen before. Confusing right?

To add on top of it all, my sister went to school at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas but moved to Franklin, Tennessee after school to be a nurse. And my brother? He also attended university in Fort Worth but now has moved to Costa Mesa, California to work and live with his wife.

All this to say, home is a confusing topic in my world, and I am working to explore in my artwork. I want to cling to the feeling, but are all feelings fleeting? Is a home defined by the structure? People? Memories? I have urgency to archive my memories through journaling documentation, taking photographs, and collecting ephemera from my experiences and travel. Yet I am sorting through what it means to tell a complete and holistic story. It scares me that there will be a time where the only way you are remembered are by the stories you tell and the impact you have on those around you. So in my artwork, I am hoping to tell those stories, bring about a sense of home, and impact my viewers for the better out of love, peace, and everlasting joy.

Artist Statement Seven:

Rather than telling you more nonsense about me and/or my practice as a graphic designer, I am going to tell you a story that reminded me of the gentle love associated with an art practice.

Over Spring Break, I was blessed with an opportunity to travel to Italy in order to volunteer and serve at the Special Olympics World Games. After a blessing from my family, faithful support raising, and a few long travel days later, I arrived at my assignment in Bardonecchia, a small ski town in the Italian Alps. Along with ten of my closest friends, I was assigned to the snowboarding events where I assisted the athletes onto the podium for awards ceremonies and assisted in the fan zone areas.

On the last day of my job, I met a kind girl named Julia. She grew up in Venezuela but was studying architecture in Turin, so her school allowed her the opportunity to travel to serve as well. Her English-speaking ability was subpar, but far better than my Italian. Over a few separate conversations we became closer, and Julia became an important friend to me over my time volunteering.

The original mission for my friends and I was to share our faiths with other athletes that we meet to expand our ministry, Athletes in Action. To do this, we were given these bracelets to hand out to friends we made along the way laying out the gospel. I knew I had to give one to Julia. After I offered her the “regalo piccolo,” she was touched and told me she had a gift for me as well. Out of her pocket comes a beautiful Italian leather-bound sketchbook. She leans into it and rips out this beautiful sketch of the Alps and a watercolor that she completed on the train ride over.

I was touched by without her knowing my love for art, she spoke to the beautiful reality of how art transcends language barriers and provides opportunity for memory and connection. Thank you, Julia, for reminding me of one of many reasons I love to create.

Artist Statement Eight:

My name is Ashley Kirschner. I am an artist. I claim to specialize in graphic design but would argue that most of our hobbies are a form of art as well: cooking, baking, playing the ukulele, journaling, playing sports, photography, family time. Some of these are explicitly obvious, but I will expand on a few others.

Sports are an artform that often goes unnoticed. I play soccer and there is elegance in the creative authority each player has when on the ball. A perfect combination of calculations—speed, direction, angle of how to hit the ball—and the artistic and creative decisions or expression in each style of play. The players move around the field with the fluidity like a paintbrush meeting the canvas, with intentional ambiguity and abstraction.

I argue family time is an artform all the same because of the uniqueness of each family in combination with the attention to detail required to navigate those relationships. Family is a space where you are invited to take off your mask and display your most authentic self. In theory, a place to process through life’s biggest questions with forgiveness if all fails. Family allows us to come exactly as we are, and they often reflect the deepest parts of our hearts right back to us, just as a successful painting or artwork shows us something about ourselves as well.

My art practice aims to capture a holistic view of how each interest or quirk in our lives tell the story of the entire person. Based on the simple concept of parts making up wholes, my own art pieces all make up me as a whole: my thoughts, feelings, explorations, questions, dreams, and processing of the world around me.

So yes, my name is Ashley Kirschner, and I study graphic design. But isn’t it clear that we are all more than a label or occupation? Rather a combination of all the special puzzle pieces placed at exactly the right location to make up a beautiful whole.

As a part of my imposter syndrome and final project, I wrote out what my family called the “daily dozen” as my entry of advice to give the world. This was a list of twelve things that I used to recite and talk through with my dad every night before going to bed when I was younger, and as life gets stressful and more confusing in your mid-twenties, I think we should all be asking ourselves these check in questions and living out the commands from five-year-old me. Here are the daily dozen:

1. Did you laugh today?
2. Did you make your bed?
3. Protect your brother and sister.
4. Say you’re sorry.
5. Ask questions and stay curious.
6. Fill your friends’ buckets.
7. Respect your mother.
8. Did you do your homework?
9. Say hi to the bus driver.
10. Explore the outdoors.
11. What did you learn today?
12. What will you change for tomorrow?

The goal was to successfully complete nine of the twelve for the day and that is how we would classify days as wins and losses. My dad always instilled in me to “win the day” and create a “winning life,” which I greatly appreciate how he influenced my work ethic and perspective on what a win truly looks like.
